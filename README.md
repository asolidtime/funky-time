# funky time
Have you ever wanted to tell time by watching a small plastic ball dry hump a soup pot? If so, please don't interact with me. Also, check out the next section.

## running
If you want to run it (why would you want to run it?????) then install python-bluepy, find the bluetooth address of your Sphero and replace it in line 16 of funkytime.py. Then, run `python3 funkytime.py`.
